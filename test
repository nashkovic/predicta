To test the above web application, you can follow these steps:

Ensure that you have installed all the necessary libraries and frameworks used in the code, such as Flask, pandas, and requests.

Start the Flask application by running the command python app.py in your terminal.

Open a web browser and go to the URL specified by the Flask app (usually http://localhost:5000).

Enter the names of the teams you want to compare in the input fields provided on the webpage.

Click the "Predict" button to submit the form.

Wait for the Flask app to fetch the necessary data and perform the analysis. The result should be displayed on the same page below the input form.

Try entering different team names and comparing the results to see how accurate the predictor is.

If you encounter any errors or issues, check the console or log files for error messages that may help you troubleshoot the problem.
